I'm Jakes1403!

I'm a guy from Louisiana who *loves* to make games!

A lot of my repos are private, but here you will find lots of stuff related to gamedev.

I make a lot of my tools from scratch, and I'm sure you will find some of them useful if/when they get released.

Here is a screenshot of an old project, Thruster, a fully featured 2D game engine written in C++.

A game has already been created with it, you can check it out [here](https://jakes1403.itch.io/boxpushinggame)!
